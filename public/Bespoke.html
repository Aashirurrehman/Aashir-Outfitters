            <h2>Our Certificates & Programs for 2021</h2>
            <p>
              With the rise of online learning, there's no shortage of classes you
              can take that offer you a certification in a particular trade, skill
              or software program. But outside of positions that require
              certifications — pilots, emergency medical technicians and insurance
              agents, for example — do any of these make a real difference in a
              job application? We reached out to recruiters and HR professionals
              to get the answer. The consensus: Certifications certainly can make
              a difference, but not all certifications are created equal. Below
              are some of the ones that recruiters say actually move the needle in
              their decision to hire a candidate — if one of them is relevant to
              your field, consider looking into it!
